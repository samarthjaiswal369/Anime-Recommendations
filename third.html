<u>Description:-</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and diligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. After the death of his father, he becomes the sole provider for his household, selling charcoal in nearby villages. He returns home one day to discover his family has been slaughtered by a demon. His younger sister, Nezuko, is the only survivor, though she has been transformed into a demon herself. She exhibits the unusual trait of retaining some human emotion and cognition. The pair are discovered by Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, who sends Tanjiro to be trained by his own former mentor, Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro vows to become a Demon Slayer to avenge his family and find a way to return Nezuko to humanity.

After mastering the "Water Breathing" swordsmanship style, Tanjiro passes the Corps' final selection. Nezuko, who has been placed under a hypnotic suggestion by Urokodaki to suppress her demonic urges, accompanies him. During a mission in Asakusa, they encounter Muzan Kibutsuji, the progenitor of all demons and the one responsible for the murder of their family. They also befriend Tamayo and her assistant Yushiro, two demons who have freed themselves from Muzan's control. Tamayo agrees to develop a cure for Nezuko, a process that requires blood from the powerful Twelve Kizuki, Muzan's most elite subordinates.

Tanjiro and Nezuko are joined in their mission by fellow Demon Slayers Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira. Together, they defeat several members of the Twelve Kizuki. During a fierce battle, Tanjiro awakens a mysterious and powerful swordsmanship technique known as "Hinokami Kagura". Their actions draw the attention of the Hashira, the Corps' highest-ranking swordsmen, and they are brought before the organization's leader, Kagaya Ubuyashiki. He sanctions their continued partnership, believing the siblings are pivotal to defeating Muzan.

Muzan, enraged by the failures of his Lower Ranks, executes them and orders the sole survivor to kill Tanjiro. After a battle aboard a moving train, Tanjiro prevails with the aid of the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku, who is subsequently killed by the Upper Three demon, Akaza. The group continues their campaign, assisting the Sound Hashira in defeating Upper Six and later helping the Mist and Love Hashira eliminate Upper Five and Upper Four at the Swordsmith Village. During these events, Nezuko develops an immunity to sunlight, making her the key to Muzan's goal of overcoming his own fatal weakness. Tanjiro also learns his Hinokami Kagura is derived from "Sun Breathing", the original swordsmanship style created by Yoriichi Tsugikuni.

The Demon Slayer Corps prepares for a final confrontation as Tamayo works on a serum. Muzan launches a preemptive assault, prompting Kagaya to sacrifice himself in a suicide attack. The Hashira engage Muzan, but he traps them within the Infinity Castle, where they must battle the remaining Upper Ranks. Through great sacrifice, the demons Akaza, Doma, and Kokushibo are defeated. Muzan kills Tamayo but is severely weakened by the poison she implanted in him. Forced above ground, a desperate battle ensues as the remaining Demon Slayers fight to hold him until sunrise. Though most of the Hashira perish, Tanjiro delivers the final blow. With his last breath, Muzan transforms Tanjiro into a demon, but Nezuko, now fully human, helps reverse the transformation.

In the aftermath of Muzan's defeat, all demons under his control perish. The Demon Slayer Corps is disbanded, with only two Hashira surviving. Tanjiro and Nezuko return to their mountain home, their journey finally complete. In the ensuing years, Tanjiro marries Kanao Tsuyuri, Inosuke weds Aoi Kanzaki, and Zenitsu marries Nezuko. In a modern-day epilogue, their descendants and reincarnations live in a world free from demons.</p>

<u>Description:-</u>
<br>
<br>
<p>Yuji Itadori is a high school student with unnatural physical strength and athletic ability. One day at school, his friends attract Curses by unsealing a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer student Megumi Fushiguro, tasked with retrieving the finger, unwittingly becoming host to the powerful ancient sorcerer Ryomen Sukuna. The leaders of the Jujutsu Society intend to exorcise Sukuna, and Yuji by extension. However, noticing Yuji's capability to retain control over his body, Satoru Gojo—Megumi's teacher and the strongest sorcerer in the modern Jujutsu world—brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School for training. Gojo has Yuji's execution postponed until he consumes all twenty of Sukuna's fingers, thereby enabling Sukuna's complete destruction through his death.

Meanwhile, a group of intelligent Cursed Spirits plot an elaborate attack to reform Jujutsu according to their ideals, beginning with sealing away Gojo, whose power and influence maintain order within the Jujutsu world. The group is led by Suguru Geto, a mysterious sorcerer and Curse User believed to have been killed by Gojo a year earlier, whose entourage includes the sadistic Curse Mahito, fire Curse Jogo, and nature Curse Hanami. Gojo's class of first-years—Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara Kugisaki—train by taking on missions to exorcise low-level Curses; during these, Sukuna becomes interested in Megumi's cursed technique and potential. Yuji is devastated after Mahito kills his friend Junpei Yoshino, confronting him with the harsh reality of the Jujutsu world he has entered. During an inter-school competition between the Tokyo and Kyoto branches, Mahito infiltrates Tokyo Jujutsu High and steals three "Death Paintings"—dormant half-human half-Curses—before summoning them to their full form. Yuji and Nobara exorcise two of them during a mission, leaving Choso as the sole surviving Death Painting.

On Halloween night in Shibuya, Geto's group launches their plan. Gojo destroys Hanami but is ultimately sealed by Geto, revealed to be the ancient sorcerer Kenjaku inhabiting Geto's corpse. With Gojo removed, chaos erupts. Choso defeats Yuji but spares him after a vision reveals they are brothers. Jogo force-feeds Yuji ten Sukuna fingers, allowing Sukuna to briefly take control. Sukuna kills Jogo and battles Megumi's uncontrollable shikigami Mahoraga, nearly destroying all of Shibuya in the process. Yuji witnesses Mahito killing his mentor and Gojo's colleague, Kento Nanami, and severely wounding Nobara, breaking him emotionally. With help from Kyoto student Aoi Todo, Yuji defeats Mahito, but Kenjaku absorbs the Curse and awakens countless sorcerers, advancing his millennia-old plan for a new era of Cursed Spirits.

In the aftermath, the Jujutsu higher-ups reinstate Yuji's immediate execution and appoint second-year student Yuta Okkotsu as his executioner. Loyal to Gojo, Yuta helps Yuji fake his death and joins him in seeking Master Tengen—an immortal, part-Curse part-human sorcerer. Tengen reveals Kenjaku's plan to merge the former's consciousness with the entire Japanese population through the "Culling Games"—a battle royale among the awakened sorcerers designed to accumulate vast amounts of Cursed Energy. Yuji and his allies search for a mysterious woman known as "Angel", who can unseal Gojo and help rescue Megumi's stepsister, Tsumiki, from being forced into the Culling Games. Kenjaku captures Tengen, and after finding Angel, Yuji and Megumi discover that Tsumiki's body has been overtaken by the ancient sorcerer Yorozu. Sukuna takes over, removes one of his own fingers, and forces Megumi to swallow it, transferring himself into Megumi's body. Sukuna kills Yorozu, resulting in Tsumiki's death, and crushes Megumi's will to resist his possession.

The group successfully unseals Gojo. Days later, Gojo battles Sukuna. Gojo nearly wins but drops his guard, causing a weakened Sukuna to fatally bisect him. Kenjaku is confronted by Fumihiko Takaba, a sorcerer who proves to be an effective distraction for Yuta to catch him off-guard and behead him. Before dying, Kenjaku makes Sukuna the Culling Games' master. The remaining Jujutsu Sorcerers attempt to fight Sukuna in Gojo's place but are overpowered as Sukuna regains his true form. In a flashback, it is revealed that Sukuna ate his twin brother in the womb a thousand years ago. The twin's soul reincarnated into Yuji's lineage, and Kenjaku's possession of Yuji's mother during conception combined to forge his unique physique and his capacity to host Sukuna.

With help from his allies, Yuji manages to overpower Sukuna, although Choso sacrifices himself in the process. Sukuna is stunned when Gojo reappears, only to be revealed as Yuta using Kenjaku's copied Cursed Technique to switch bodies. Yuji activates his Domain Expansion, dragging Sukuna through a vision of his hometown in a futile attempt to sway him. During this, he reaches Megumi's soul and inspires him to resist Sukuna's control. Sukuna realizes Yuji is missing one finger—used by Yuta to activate the Cursed Technique. Nobara then locates Sukuna's last finger, hidden by Gojo, and uses her Cursed Technique to strike it, simultaneously damaging Sukuna's soul and allowing Yuji to deliver a final blow. Megumi successfully frees himself from Sukuna, who disintegrates away after refusing a final chance from Yuji.

After the battle, Yuta returns to his original body. Yuji, Megumi, and Nobara undertake another mission, and Yuji reflects on Gojo's hopes and trust in him. Although Sukuna's last finger is shown, his defeat makes his return unlikely.</p>
